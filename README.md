### Demo

# Features
- ## Manager UI
  - Create, remove, and edit slash commands using a simple UI.
  - Configure the name, description, arguments, aliases, and permissions.
  - Add functionality on command execution.

# Commands
- `/commands` - `easyas.command.manager`
- `/resetcommands` - `easyas.command.reset`

# Tutorial
### *Using In-Game UI*
1) With **operator** or the `easyas.command.manager` permission, run the `/commands` command.
2) This is where you can add, remove, and edit existing commands.
   - Next click 'Add Command'.
3) Here you can configure all of the different attributes of your command.
   - For more information, refer to the wiki page, [Command Attributes](../../wiki/Command-Attributes).
   - Try creating the following command:
     - Set the name to '`star`'.
     - Add a new usage '`/star`'.
     - Add the permission '`easyas.command.all`'.
   - After that, scroll to the bottom and click **Functionality**.
4) This is where you can make the command *do* something when it is executed. Let's do a simple example.
   - Click 'Add Execution', and type '`give "{player}" nether_star 1`'.
   - If you want to learn more about functionality, see the wiki page [Functionality](../../wiki/Functionality).
   - When you are finished, hit **Submit**, then back out again to the main editor.
5) Click **Submit**, and your server will reload to apply your new command.
6) Now run `/star`; you should be given a nether star.

### *Using JSON Editor*
1) For more advanced users, a more efficient approach is to edit the JSON directly.
To start, navigate to your `/bedrock_server/config/` folder; the `/config/` folder should be in the same directory as your `/plugins/` folder.
2) Open `command_manager.json` in your choice of text editor. You don't need anything fancy; Notepad will do.
3) Begin editing. Refer to the wiki page [JSON Arguments](../../wiki/JSON-Arguments) for available arguments.
Once done, save the file and reload/restart your server for the changes to take effect.

### ðŸ¥³ Congratulations!
You've created your first command!

I hope you find this plugin useful! Enjoy!
